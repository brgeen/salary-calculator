# Salary Calculator

## Description

This application is for business managers and accountants to keep track of their companies employees payroll. I created a simple application to gather pertinent employee data, store that data, and display it in an easy to read table. The calculator takes the employee's annual salaries, adds them together, and displays the total monthly payroll expense for the business. If the monthly payroll expense exceeds $20,000.00 the font will turn red, alerting the user that the monthly payroll expense has been surpassed.
